What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

** to initialize any directory as a git directory just go inside that directory and run command git init, that directory will be initialized as a git directory.
The new git directrory doesnt have any commits until we do, so when we run command git log on this, fatal: bad default revision 'HEAD', this error appears because 'HEAD' represents the recent commit, and as there is not any commit when we initialize any directory as a git directory, it throws this error message.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

working dir => staging dir => git repository

The files which we want to put in the git repo, we add them to staging first using git add.
After this we use command git commit to push these changes to git repo.

git init = to initialize the dir as a git dir
git add = to add the files from working dir to git repo
git commit = to push all the files in staging dir to git repo
git status = to check  the status of working dir and git repo
